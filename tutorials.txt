If you go inside the application.properties file, you can see which DB is configured, either H2 in memory, or PostgreSQL
If H2 then after starting the app, you can navigate to the app web console, to connect to the DB, view tables etc:
    http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

If you want to use the app, you can check the Controller class to see what paths are available and what operations..
    StudentController
