       Spring Data abstracts all the complexity needed for a developer to interact with a DB.
       It is an abstraction over JPA and Hibernate, which simplifies DB interaction with a developer.

       When creating entity classes, always use the JPA annotations...not the hibernate ones
       (need to make sure about this from the official documentation)

       The goad of the Repository classes is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for accessing data for
       various persistance stores.

        -unlike the normal Servlet architecture, where in web.xml you specify the request mappings and which servlet will handle them,
        in spring MVC you can have only 1 servlet configured in web.xml, DispatcherServlet, which acts like a front controller, that
        dispatches the requests to various classes annotated with @Controller. You only need to specify in which package should Spring
        search for the Controller classes.

            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41092751/spring-injects-dependencies-in-constructor-without-autowired-annotation
                Starting with Spring 4.3, if a class, which is configured as a Spring bean, has only one constructor,
                the @Autowired annotation can be omitted and Spring will use that constructor and inject all necessary
                dependencies.
                Regarding the default constructor: You either need the default constructor, a constructor with the @Autowired
                annotation when you have multiple constructors, or only one constructor in your class with or without the
                @Autowired annotation.

        IN spring boot, when you build you app, you get a jar, that has inside an embedded server..this means
        that once you have that jar, and a jvm you can run your app, without needing another webserver or application
        server.
            "For servlet stack applications, the spring-boot-starter-web includes Tomcat by including
            spring-boot-starter-tomcat , but you can use spring-boot-starter-jetty or spring-boot-starter-undertow instead"

        spring can work with jsp pages or thymeleaf template files..maybe others too

        methods from the @Controller that handle the http requests can have the HttpServletRequest and/or
        HttpServletResponse parameter, just like in the case of servlets, and one can extract data from them etc
        Or you can use HttpSession in those method signatures, and will be getting, via injection, an instance of the
        HttpSession

        for rapid prototyping one can use H2 in memory database : https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html
        it has in browser console from which you can view data etc
            https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-h2-database        (this is configured in application.properties..depeding
            on what is and is not commented there, it should work...also check tutorials.txt file)

        the REST part of spring boot works by default with JSON...if you want xml to be supported, you will need to just
        add a jackson xml dependency, and obvious if the client requests an xml response, he will get one automatically
